Make a fork of **darin-oc/banner_access_control** and then clone the fork you made to your localhost. Once you've cloned your fork you will be able to sync and commit your changes to that fork you've created. Be sure to sync and commit very often, however, you should only commit code that works.

You can send a **Pull Request** to me whenever you are ready once you have made some commits to your fork. When i receive your **Pull Request** I will take a look at your code and may make some suggestions to you about your code. We will be able to have back-and-forth dialogue about your code. Once I'm happy with your code I will attempt to merge your fork with **darin-oc/banner_access_control**. If I find any conflicts I will attempt to resolve them.

Once I've merged some **Pull Requests** you should try to merge your own fork with **darin-oc/banner_access_control** so that your fork is up-to-date with everyone else's.
